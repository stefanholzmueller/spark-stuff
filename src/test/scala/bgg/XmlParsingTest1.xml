						               													<description>Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to 5 players and adds a shorter 5 round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Die Macher is #1 in the Valley Games Classic Line&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

This game never plays the same way twice, the elements of negotiation and strategy make this a classic game.  Its a good length (4-5 hours) that encourages socialization (even if its simply in the manner of, hey, you just screwed me over!)  If you&#039;ve never played it, grab 4 of your closest gamer friends, several six-packs of german beer (or a couple bottles of wine) and expect a really good evening." />

Perfect blend of old-school depth/length with new-school elegant interlocking mechanics. And the theme is cool, too. REALLY glad I made the investment. Based on 2 plays, both solitaire - says alot about a game, eh?" />
									<comment username="Richard_Huzzey" rating="10" value="Truly this game is great.

A fantastic design-- if only there was enough time to play it more often." />
									<comment username="Danisme" rating="10" value="THE game, I always wanted. It has one of the most complicated mechanisms, at least among euros. Still it works! and works beautifully. It&#039;s like Republic of Rome in some sense. It has the same depth, tension and level of player interaction. Yet it&#039;s much more controllable and avoids unpredictable luck. Sophisticated, elegant and deep." />
									<comment username="Blackpope" rating="10" value="This is the game, my personal n.1. Many strategic and tactical decisions to be made. It needs planning, dealing and also skill in taking opportunities when they present. The theme may seems dry, but once you play you&#039;re grabbed and the 4 hours a match usually last fly away. 
Reccomended. 
Ownership and use is necessary for every true geek. " />

The game takes 4 hours, yes... but it will be the best 4 hours you ever spent playing a game. Just one point, if you don&#039;t like games that have a lot of options, lots of player interaction, a great &quot;screw you&quot; factor, takes longer than 45 minuets, or requires you to use your brain and keep your head in the game, please don&#039;t play this game.

									<comment username="tmdba37" rating="10" value="What other rating could Die Macher have really? Especially taking into account my love for longer, meatier games. . .this is definitely one of the all time bests. The thing about Die Macher for me is the constant balance between management of the future regions and the current scoring region. . .being able to pick and choose where you need to strike and ultimately making your move in the end game. . .something I have yet to master but hope to have the time to do so with many more plays. . .great game!" />

Edit - It&#039;s grown.  3rd best game I have ever played.  Upgrade to 10 where it belongs." />

									<comment username="cwmassey" rating="10" value="A four hour game that never feels like four hours - truly a great game.  I really think that if you played this more than once a year, that you could trim the time a little bit as well.  " />
									<comment username="John Weber" rating="10" value="This is simply my favorite game of all time.  It has many different mechanisms (auctions, turn order, placements, multiple options, resource management) and is a very intense four hour experience that is also an excellent simulation of electoral politics as well as the best game of all time.  I own the 1997 edition from RGG, which improved on the very poor components and sometimes fiddly math from the first edition game, which I started playing around 1990 although I never owned a copy.  Only problem is the steep learning curve, substantially longer playing time (not an issue with me but it is for many people) and finding the right group to play it with.  Definitely better with 5 than 4, and I usually pre-arrange most game sessions in advance although I have had fun in some pick-up games recently." />

									<comment username="lswaage" rating="10" value="2004 Impressions are good after first 4-player game.  It&#039;s highly strategic; planning ahead and cooperation (coalitions) is vital.  Rating might increase with play.  We played a couple of rules wrong, and I believe it&#039;s even better with five players.

8/2008 Finally managed to play a complete 5-player game within acceptable time.  (Having (at least) one player knowing the game well really helps.)  All players start the game on an equal field with all the same possibilities and &quot;enough&quot; resources.  Winning is just a matter of good planning and knowing which fights to stand and which to ignore.  This is a treasure chest in boardgaming and there&#039;s still a lot of depth to be discovered.  Rating up 9 -&gt; 10.

You want to play this with 5 people who want to play, 1 or 2 who have had their arms twisted can easily ruin it for all. " />
									<comment username="Elf__Man" rating="10" value="Hands down, my Favorite game.  Has a two turn learning curve.  The first two games I played I lost horribly.  Went out and purchased immeadiately after 2nd game.

									<comment username="Chrisrob" rating="10" value="I have now played this game a number of times.  A very interesting system.  It is very &quot;full&quot; (lots of tasks) to it takes someone with a wargamer background to be able to last.  But every action by another player effects your own issues so is it like you are participating in another&#039;s turn.

Often when I have played this game two if not three of the players were new to the game; though some had tried to learn the rules in advance.  The first game I played took six hours as well as the second game; the third took seven hours.  In a forced game I could see going five hours but it is far nicer to pace one&#039;s self and just say it will take six (it has taken this long even with all players having played before).

It seems that the actual playing time can be faster, but when rules &amp; setup time are added, this is a long game.

It is not super complicated as much as there are many steps in every turn making the process take time.  Those new to the game get the grasp of it enough to make their decisions after one or two rounds (of six); though in every case they would have wanted to try things diffently if played again.  THIS GAME IS MUCH BETTER WITH THE HELP SHEETS THAT CAN BE FOUND HERE AT BGG; they keep track of all the steps.  I do think it takes playing once or twice in order to get the management of money &amp; resources down so that a stratagy could be followed better during playing.

It is a most interesting way to set up an election game, still making me think the same format could be used to represent the primary process in American presidential elections.

I also have a copy of the original &quot;blue box&quot; edition which has only four parties and seems a little different in its structure. (I have never played this version.)

I also have the newer Valley Games printing but find the shorter five turn version ruins the game." />

									<comment username="Thommy8" rating="10" value="Reprint just arrived from Valley Games, and I&#039;m really looking forward to trying this one out.  Then I can finally decide whether Ra or Die Macher should win the constant struggle between them, heh -- UPDATE: Wow!  This game has everything.  It seems far more daunting than it should because of the number of phases on each turn, but most of the phases are pretty straightforward, and everything ties together so nicely that the time really flies by.  I&#039;m normally not a fan of games with too much luck or chaos, but this one gives you just enough control to make it work. I can&#039;t get enough!
